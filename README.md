# Shutdown-Prank-V2
Version 2 of my previous shutdown prank. Education purposes only... or something.
You are allowed to use the code. You are NOT allowed to change the code for something malicious. This is intended for education purposes only, do NOT add malicious code to this program. I am also not responsible for anything that happens if you go against my wishes and add malicious code. 

If the program does not work, make sure you both have python3 installed. If you do not, it will not function correctly. Any issues made saying "It doesn't work, and it crashes on start" will be ignored if you do not state that python3 is installed. If there is an issue, send the console log and I will try to help.

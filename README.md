# Shutdown-Prank-V2
Version 2 of my previous shutdown prank. Education purposes only... or something.
You are allowed to use the code. You are NOT allowed to change the code for something malicious. This is intended for education purposes only, do NOT add malicious code to this program. I am also not responsible for anything that happens if you go against my wishes and add malicious code. 

If it does not work, make sure you have python3 installed. If I see an issue saying "It doesn't work" and you didn't state you have python3, note that it is a dependency, otherwise it will not function correctly. I will close any issue that refuses to list two things: Console Errors and whether you have python3 installed or not.
